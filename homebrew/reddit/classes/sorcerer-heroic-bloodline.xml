			<p>Your lineage empowers and emboldens you. At 1st level your hitpoint maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class. When your spellcasting feature lets you learn or replace a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose a spell from the paladin spell list or the sorcerer spell list. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting a spell and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you.</p>

			<p>Due to your heritage you can use weapons as an extension of your will. At 1st level you gain proficiency with light and medium armor, shields, and martial weapons. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks the two-handed property. When you attack with that weapon you can use your Charisma modifier instead, of Strength or Dexterity, for attack and damage rolls and you can use it as a focus for your sorcerer spells. This benefits last until you finish a long rest.</p>

			<p>You have learned to combine magic and swordplay in a deadly combination. At 6th level you can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the attack action on your turn. When you take the attack action, you can expend 3 sorcery points to perform one of the following techniques:</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Ethereal Strike.</i></b> Creatures on a 10 foot line in front of you must succeed a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking the full damage of the first attack on a failure and half as much on a success.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Warping Strike.</i></b> Before attacking you magically teleport as a bonus action up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of a hostile creature you can see, you then attack as normal.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Weakening Strike.</i></b> On a hit, the target of your attack must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against you spell save DC, on a failure spell attack roles you make against that creature have advantage until the end of your next turn.</p>
